# Phase 1.2: Challenge

You'll have 3 minutes to create a Machine Learning model that classifies e-commerce products into categories.

## Requirements
- Use ML.NET Model Builder in Visual Studio or the ML.NET CLI (cross-platform)
- Use [this e-commerce dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luisquintanilla/mlnet-workshop/master/data/flipkart_com-ecommerce_sample.csv) for training (note: right-click the link and select "Save link as...").
- Make sure you train AND use an ML.NET model to make predictions in a .NET app.


## Hints
- To open **Model Builder**, open Visual Studio and create a new project. In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and select Add > Machine Learning.
- If you're using the **ML.NET CLI**, try the *mlnet --help* command to see your options.
- Train for at least 40 seconds.
